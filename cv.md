## Briefly about myself:

My name is _Eugene_. I'm _29_ years old. And I'm from _Belarus_. I'm here at the beginning of the journey to become a _junior frontend developer_. And I'll try my best to achieve this goal. It'll be difficult but we don't give up. And this is the start of learning new things. Wish me luck.

## Code example:

Finish the solution so that it sorts the passed in array of numbers. If the function passes in an empty array or null/nil value then it should return an empty array.

```
function solution(nums){
  if (nums === null || nums === undefined) {
    return []
  }
  return nums.sort((a,b) => a - b)
}
```
